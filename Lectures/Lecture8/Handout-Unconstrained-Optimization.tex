A point $x_0$ is a critical/stationary point if $f'(x_0)=0$. \\

Find all the critical points for the following function:
$$ f(x)= x^3-12x^2+36x+8 $$

%$3x^2-24x + 36 = 3x^2-6x-18x+36 = 3x(x-2)-18(x-2) = 3(x-6)(x-2)$

\vspace{5cm}

Denote the two critical points by $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the sign of $f'(x)$ for $x<x_1^*$ in the immediate neighborhood of $x_1^*$? \\
  \item What is the sign of $f'(x)$ for $x>x_1^*$ in the immediate neighborhood of $x_1^*$? \\
  \item What is the sign of $f'(x)$ for $x<x_2^*$ in the immediate neighborhood of $x_2^*$? \\
  \item What is the sign of $f'(x)$ for $x<x_2^*$ in the immediate neighborhood of $x_2^*$? \\
\end{itemize}

What are the maximum and minimum points for this function? Draw a graph for this function.

The second derivative of a function $f(x)$ is the derivative of $f'(x)$. \\

Find the second derivative of the above function. What is the value of $f''(x)$ at $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$?

 Given the quadratic profit function $$\pi(Q)=h Q^2+j Q+k$$ 
 What parameter restrictions are called for to reflect the following assumptions: 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item[(a).] If nothing is produced, the profit will be negative (because of fixed costs).
  \vspace{2cm}
  
  \item[(b).] The profit function is strictly concave ($\pi''(Q)<0$ for all $Q$).
    \vspace{6cm}

  \item[(c).] The maximum profit occurs at a positive output level $Q^*$.
\end{itemize}
