If you are taking this course for graduate credit, you will need to complete a project. The grade for the project will count in place of the active engagement grade. The project is due on the last day of class. 

You only need to complete this assignment if you are graduate student taking this course for credit, undergraduate students are not required to complete this assignment, but can do so for fun and I would be happy to check your work, but it will not count towards your grade.

This project will teach you how to use Python programming to solve a simple mathematical problem with some economic intution. The choice of programming language does not matter, but I chose Python since it's widely used in the industry and academia and most importantly it's open source and free.

There are two different assignments you can choose from. You only need to complete one of the three assignments. For each assignment, you need to know some basic Python programming and set up. So use the sidebar and go through the Python setup and basic programming tutorials. Once you are done, each of the excercises build on an example or problem we solbed in class, and shows you how to code that problem. Once you understand the code, you will need to modify it to solve a related but expanded problem to the original problem and perform the tasks outlined. 

The assignments are as follows:

1. **Gasoline or electric cars**: This assignment builds on the example we did in class where we used linear algebra to solve a supply and demand system. I will show how we can use the simple 1 good case to derive some comparative statics and then you are expected to extend this to a 2 good case with gasoline and electric cars.
2. **Demand for goods**: This assignment builds on the example we did in class where we derived demand for goods given a utility function. I will show how we can use Python to solve for the demand of goods given the Cobb-Douglas utility function, you are then expected to extend this to a CES utility function and do some comparative statics.
   

### Exercise 1

Gasoline or electric cars. 

Demand for gasoline cars is a function of price of both.

$$ Q^d_{g} = c_g - a_g P_{g} + b_g P_{e} $$
$$ Q^d_{e} = c_e - a_e P_{e} + b_e P_{g} $$

Where $Q^d_{g}$ is the log of quantity demanded of gasoline cars, $Q^d_{e}$ is log of the quantity demanded of electric cars, $P_{g}$ is the log price of gasoline cars, and $P_{e}$ is the price of electric cars. $a_g$, $b_g$, $c_g$, $a_e$, $b_e$, and $c_e$ are some known parameters, say estimated from data. Here $a_g$ and $a_e$ are the price elasticities of demand for gasoline and electric cars, respectively. While, $b_g$ and $b_e$ are the cross price elasticities of demand for gasoline and electric cars, respectively ie. how the price of one good affects the demand for the other good.

Producers can produce gasoline cars or electric cars. In the short run, they are constrained by the amount of capital they have, so if they want to produce more of one type of car, they have to produce less of the other.

$$ Q^s_{g} = \alpha_g K - \beta_g Q^s_{e} $$
$$ Q^s_{e} = \alpha_e K - \beta_e Q^s_{g} $$
